# Kalender

A static, GitHub Pages friendly calendar app with Supabase Auth, shared
calendars, collaborative events, realtime updates, drag-and-drop rescheduling,
dark mode, search, filters, and a weekly overview.

## Project structure

- `index.html` — app shell and dialogs
- `css/styles.css` — responsive light/dark design system
- `js/config.js` — Supabase URL/key and the fallback tag color/name **(gitignored; see below)**
- `js/config.example.js` — template/shape for `js/config.js`
- `js/supabaseClient.js` — singleton Supabase client
- `js/api.js` — Supabase Auth, database, and realtime calls
- `js/store.js` — single mutable state object plus selectors
- `js/dateUtils.js` — pure date helpers
- `js/quickAdd.js` — pure Quick Add input parser
- `js/htmlSafe.js` — `escapeHtml` and `safeColor` (XSS defenses for renderers)
- `js/ui.js` — DOM rendering and form read/write helpers
- `js/app.js` — application boot, state transitions, and event handlers
- `supabase/schema.sql` — tables, triggers, RLS policies, and realtime setup
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Pages deploy with secret injection

## Configuration

`js/config.js` holds the Supabase project URL and publishable (anon) key. It is
**gitignored** so credentials never land in the repository.

### Local development

```bash
cp js/config.example.js js/config.js
# Edit js/config.js and replace the two placeholders with your Supabase values.
node server.mjs
# Open http://127.0.0.1:4173/
```

A static server is required (rather than opening `index.html` directly) because
the app loads ES modules.

#### What the dev environment actually does

There is no offline mock. Whatever Supabase URL and publishable key you put in
`js/config.js` is what the local app hits — **the same project as production
if you reuse the prod key, or a separate dev project if you point at one**.
Pick consciously: poking at events on localhost while pointed at the prod
project will mutate prod data through RLS just like the deployed site would.
A common pattern is to keep a second Supabase project for dev and switch the
config file's two values when iterating.

If sign-in fails with `Invalid login credentials`, it is almost never a local
environment issue (password sign-in does not enforce Site URL or CORS). The
two real causes are:

- The key in `js/config.js` points at a project where the user does not exist
  (or `email_confirmed_at` is null on that user's row).
- Wrong password.

Fix by creating/confirming the user in Supabase Studio → Authentication →
Users on the project the key actually points at.

#### Codex Preview integration

`.Codex/launch.json` registers the static server with the Codex Preview
tool so a session can start it, screenshot it, and read browser console logs
without leaving the chat:

```jsonc
// .Codex/launch.json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "kalender",
      "runtimeExecutable": "wsl.exe",
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "-d", "Ubuntu",
        "--cd", "/home/tamachi/kalender",
        "--", "bash", "-lc", "node server.mjs"
      ],
      "port": 4173
    }
  ]
}
```

The `wsl.exe` wrapper is needed because Codex runs on Windows while the
project lives inside WSL (`\\wsl.localhost\ubuntu\…`). Node is installed in
WSL, not on the Windows PATH, so a direct `node server.mjs` from the Windows
side fails with `ENOENT`. WSL2's localhost forwarder makes `127.0.0.1:4173`
reachable from the Windows-side preview pane automatically. If you switch
distro or the WSL home path, update `-d` and `--cd`. If you run Codex
natively on macOS/Linux against a checked-out copy, replace the entry with:

```jsonc
{ "name": "kalender", "runtimeExecutable": "node", "runtimeArgs": ["server.mjs"], "port": 4173 }
```

To use it inside a session: ask Codex to "start the preview server" — it
will call `preview_start` on the `kalender` config, and from there it can
screenshot the page, evaluate JS in the page context, and tail the browser
console while you click around.

### CI / GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` regenerates `js/config.js` on every deploy from
two repository secrets:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

Set them under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** on GitHub. Pages
must be configured with **Source: GitHub Actions** under **Settings → Pages**.

## Supabase setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Enable Email/Password under Authentication providers.
3. Create users manually in Authentication. There is intentionally no public
   sign-up UI.
4. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the SQL editor.
5. For an existing project that pre-dates the tag/archive features, also run
   `supabase/feature_updates.sql`. If calendar inserts fail with an RLS error,
   run `supabase/rls_fix_calendars.sql`. For Custom Quick Add templates, also
   run `supabase/2026-05-add-quick-add-templates.sql`. For the move from
   user-owned tags to calendar-scoped tags, run
   `supabase/2026-05-calendar-scoped-tags.sql`. After verifying the new tag
   flow with two real users (see "Tags" below), apply
   `supabase/2026-05-calendar-scoped-tags-cleanup.sql` to drop the legacy
   user-scoped rows and add the deferred `NOT NULL` /
   `unique(calendar_id, name)` constraints. Then apply
   `supabase/2026-05-events-tag-id-index.sql` (covers the delete-tag
   reassign/count paths). Finally, apply
   `supabase/2026-05-color-format-check.sql` to enforce a strict 6-digit hex
   format on `tags.color` and `calendars.color` (defends against stored XSS
   via a malicious color string from a calendar collaborator).
6. In Authentication URL configuration, add your GitHub Pages URL to allowed
   redirect/site URLs.

The app uses these tables:

- `calendars` — owner-created calendars, with optional `archived_at` for hiding
  calendars without deleting their data.
- `calendar_members` — access control with `owner`, `collaborator`, and
  `viewer` roles.
- `profiles` — a safe public profile table populated from Supabase Auth for
  email-based sharing.
- `tags` — calendar-scoped tags with names and colors. Every newly created
  calendar is auto-seeded by the `seed_calendar_tags` trigger with six tags:
  `Untagged`, `Work`, `Personal`, `Urgent`, `Focus`, `Travel`. Members read,
  owners and collaborators write.
- `events` — shared events with title, description, time range, mandatory
  `tag_id` (color and name come from the joined `tags` row), completion
  state, and optional reminder.

RLS ensures users can only read calendars they belong to. Owners can share
calendars, owners and collaborators can modify events, and viewers can only
read.

## Tests

Unit tests live under `test/` and run on Node's built-in test runner — no
install, no bundler, no dev dependencies.

```bash
npm test
```

Covers the Quick Add parser, date helpers, store selectors, and the two
HTML-safety helpers (`escapeHtml`, `safeColor`). UI flows that need a real
browser, and the RLS smoke checks that need a second Supabase user, live
in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) as a manual checklist — run it before
deploying any UI or data-flow change.

`npm test` runs `scripts/ensure-config.mjs` first, which copies
`js/config.example.js` → `js/config.js` if missing, because `js/store.js`
statically imports two constants from `config.js` (which is gitignored).

There is no CI configuration for tests — they're a local pre-deploy gate.

## Architecture, RLS, and schema changes

Architectural invariants (module layering, optimistic-update pattern, the
three-field tag rule, RLS policies, the schema-change runbook) live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Read it before making non-trivial changes.

## Tags and archiving

Tags are **calendar-scoped**: each calendar has its own tag list and a tag
created in calendar A only shows up in pickers for calendar A. Settings
groups tags by calendar; only calendars where you have editor access show
the "+ Add tag" affordance.

Each newly created calendar is automatically seeded with six tags by the
`seed_calendar_tags` SQL trigger:

- `Untagged` (gray) — the per-calendar default. Events whose tag is deleted
  are reassigned here. The UI prevents deleting `Untagged`, and the
  `events.tag_id` foreign key is `on delete restrict` as a database-level
  safety net.
- `Work`, `Personal`, `Urgent`, `Focus`, `Travel` — match the legacy
  `events.category` enum so events from before the migration keep their
  visual grouping.

Events store only a `tag_id`; color and name are read from the joined `tags`
row at render time. There is no `events.category` or `events.color` after
the migration.

### Authorization

| Action | Allowed for |
|---|---|
| Read tags in a calendar | any member of that calendar |
| Create / edit / delete tags | owner or collaborator of that calendar |

A viewer-role user sees the calendar's tags on events but cannot open the
"+ Add tag" affordance, and any direct mutation attempt is blocked by RLS.

### Tag deletion

Deleting a tag opens a confirmation modal listing the affected event count
(authoritative — fetched from the database, not the in-memory window). On
confirm the app reassigns every affected event to the calendar's `Untagged`
tag and then deletes the original. If reassignment fails the original is
left intact and the modal stays open with the error.

### Custom Quick Add templates and tags

Templates are user-scoped (one set per user) but their `default_tag` points
at a tag in the template's `default_calendar_id`. Switching the default
calendar in the template form refreshes the tag dropdown. If a template's
tag becomes invalid for a new calendar (or was nulled out by the migration),
the Quick Add still applies — just with no tag pre-selected.

Calendar archiving updates `calendars.archived_at`. Archived calendars are
hidden from the normal calendar list by default and can be shown/restored from
Settings. If archive or restore fails with a missing-column error, run the
latest `supabase/feature_updates.sql` migration.

Calendar deletion removes a row from `calendars`. Related `calendar_members`
and `events` rows are cleaned up by `on delete cascade`, and RLS allows this
only for owners.

## Quick Add

The Day Detail view has a Quick Add input for creating events without opening
the full sheet. Type a phrase, hit Enter, and the event sheet opens with the
detected fields prefilled — partial matches are kept, anything missing is
left blank for you to fill in.

### Syntax

A Quick Add phrase mixes a free-text title with optional date, time, and
duration tokens. The parser walks the input in passes; tokens it doesn't
recognize stay in the title.

| Token       | Examples                                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Date        | `today`, `tomorrow`, `Monday`–`Sunday`, `2026-05-12` |
| Time range  | `9-17`, `9:30-17:30`, `9 to 17`                  |
| Single time | `14:00`, `18:30`, `9`, `9am`, `1pm`              |
| Duration    | `for 1h`, `for 30m`, `for 2h30m`                 |

Examples:

- `Work tomorrow 9-17` → "Work" tomorrow, 09:00–17:00
- `Dentist Friday 14:00` → "Dentist" next Friday, 14:00–15:00
- `Gym today 18:30` → "Gym" today, 18:30–19:30
- `Meeting Monday 10-11` → "Meeting" next Monday, 10:00–11:00
- `Standup tomorrow 9 for 30m` → "Standup" tomorrow, 09:00–09:30

If a phrase is unrecognizable (no title, no date, no time), Quick Add shows
a toast and logs the raw input + parser result to the browser console.

### Custom Quick Add templates

Settings → **Custom Quick Adds** lets you define template shortcuts that
prefill Quick Add results. Each template has:

- **Shortcut keyword** — unique per user, no spaces. Matches the first word
  of a Quick Add phrase (case-insensitive).
- **Default title** — used when the rest of the phrase parses as no title.
- **Default duration (minutes)** — used as the event length when no time
  range or `for …` duration is given in the phrase.
- **Default tag** *(optional)* — applied to the event sheet on open.
- **Default calendar** *(optional)* — selected on the event sheet on open
  (only if you can still edit it).

When the first whitespace-delimited token matches a template's shortcut, the
template's defaults apply, and any parsed date/time from the rest of the
phrase layers on top:

- Template `work` (default title "Work", duration 480m, tag Work) +
  `work tomorrow 9` → "Work", tomorrow, 09:00–17:00, Work tag.
- Template `gym` (default title "Gym", duration 60m) +
  `gym today 18:30` → "Gym", today, 18:30–19:30.
- Template `lunch` (duration 45m) + `lunch friday 12 with Anna` →
  "with Anna", Friday, 12:00–12:45 (parsed title overrides default title).

Templates are stored in the `quick_add_templates` Supabase table. Run
`supabase/2026-05-add-quick-add-templates.sql` in the SQL editor to create
the table and RLS policies on an existing project.

## Mobile UI notes

The shell is mobile-first with four bottom tabs: **Calendar** (day/week/month
+ swipe), **Tasks** (search, filters, weekly overview), **Create** (opens the
type picker), **Settings** (calendars, sharing, theme, sign out).

### Day Detail View

Tapping any date in the month view opens the Day Detail View — a focused,
mobile-first screen for that day:

- A back action returns to the month view.
- A header shows the selected date in long form ("Friday, May 1").
- A single primary **Add** button opens the type picker (Event vs Task).
- Quick Add stays available for power-users who want to type a phrase like
  "Dentist Friday 14:00" and skip the picker.
- Three lists follow: **Events**, **Tasks**, and **Upcoming** (the next few
  events from later days). Empty sections show a quiet placeholder line.
- Tapping any item in those lists opens the existing edit sheet for that
  event.

The Day Detail View has no horizontal scroll; lists wrap and clip overflowing
text with an ellipsis.

### Event vs Task add flow

There is a single create flow used everywhere — the bottom-nav **Create** tab
and the Day-Detail **Add** button both open the same type-picker modal:

1. Tap **Add** (or the Create tab) → the type picker shows two large,
   touch-friendly options: **Event** or **Task**.
2. Picking **Event** opens the event sheet with the standard fields and the
   selected day prefilled as the date.
3. Picking **Task** opens the same sheet, with the title prefilled as
   `Task: ` so the user can finish the title in one tap. The selected day is
   still prefilled as the date.
4. Both flows write to the same `events` table — a "task" is just an event
   whose title starts with `Task:`. There is no separate task entity.

Because both options reuse the existing event sheet, calendar membership,
RLS, optimistic updates, and tag selection all work identically for events
and tasks.

Specific UI invariants (day-detail flow, full-width day columns, no desktop
sidebars) live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) under "Mobile UI constraints" — read
those before changing layout.

## GitHub Pages deployment

The repository deploys via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

1. On push to `main` (or manual `workflow_dispatch`), the workflow regenerates
   `js/config.js` from `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` secrets.
2. The workflow stamps the commit SHA into the `__BUILD_VERSION__` placeholder
   in `index.html` and `sw.js`, so every deploy invalidates the service-worker
   cache automatically. No manual version bump needed.
3. The repository is uploaded as the Pages artifact and deployed via
   `actions/deploy-pages@v4`. No build step.
4. Add the resulting Pages URL to your Supabase project's Authentication URL
   configuration.

## Troubleshooting blank screens

If GitHub Pages shows only a plain repository title or an empty white page,
check these first:

- Confirm `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/app.js` load with HTTP 200
  from the deployed Pages URL. All app paths are repository-relative; do not
  change them to root paths like `/js/app.js`.
- Hard-refresh or clear site data after UI patches. Older versions used a
  cache-first service worker that could keep serving a stale broken shell.
  The current service worker is network-first for app navigations.
- Run `supabase/feature_updates.sql` after pulling tag/task updates, then
  `supabase/2026-05-calendar-scoped-tags.sql` for per-calendar tags. If the
  `tags` table can't be loaded, the app shows a toast pointing at the
  migration; pickers will still render the calendar dropdown but the tag
  list will be empty until the migration is applied.
- Test locally first: `node server.mjs`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`
  and verify the browser console has no new errors.

## Developer regression checklist

Before deploying a UI or data-flow change, run through this list on a narrow
mobile viewport and watch the browser console:

- Login and logout with a manually created Supabase user.
- Confirm Settings shows the signed-in user's email; log in as another user
  and verify it updates.
- Load calendars, switch active calendars, and verify archived calendars are
  hidden until "Show archived calendars" is enabled.
- Archive and restore an owned calendar; confirm collaborators/viewers cannot
  do owner-only actions.
- Create an event with tag A, edit it to tag B, save, and verify the new
  tag/color appears in month, week, day, and day-detail views.
- Reopen the edited event and confirm tag B is selected in the bottom sheet.
- Delete an event and confirm it disappears immediately without refresh.
- Tap a month date and confirm the day-detail view opens for the exact date.
- Add an event from day detail and confirm the selected date is prefilled.
- Add a task from day detail, then complete and uncomplete it from Tasks.
- Create a tag in calendar A in Settings; switch to calendar B and confirm
  the new tag is **not** in the picker for events in calendar B.
- Switch the calendar dropdown inside an open event modal and confirm the
  tag picker re-renders against the new calendar's tags.
- Delete a tag that's in use and confirm the modal shows the affected
  count, then verify the events are still visible afterwards (now under the
  "Untagged" color).
- Sign in as a viewer-role user on a shared calendar; confirm the
  "+ Add tag" affordance is hidden and any direct API call is blocked by
  RLS.
- Create a custom Quick Add template, then verify a phrase starting with
  that shortcut prefills its defaults and that parsed date/time still wins.
- Share a calendar by email and verify unknown emails show a friendly error.
- Switch away from the browser/app and return; confirm data resyncs and
  realtime subscriptions still work without duplicated updates.
- Test airplane mode or poor network: the app shell should still load, and
  data failures should show toasts rather than blank screens.
- Confirm no horizontal overflow on Calendar, Tasks, Settings, day detail,
  and all dialogs/bottom sheets.

Common failure modes:

- **Tag edits only change visually** — open the Network tab and inspect the
  `events?id=eq.…` PATCH request. The request body's `tag_id` and the
  response row's `tag_id` should both match what was selected. If they
  diverge, the modal's tag picker is out of sync with `state.tags`.
- **RLS failures on event updates** — confirm the user is owner/collaborator
  on the event's calendar AND that the `tag_id` belongs to the same calendar
  (`can_use_tag(tag_id, calendar_id)` returns true).
- **Archive/restore errors** — run the latest feature migration so
  `calendars.archived_at` exists.
- **Stale UI after deployment** — should not occur (cache version is stamped
  per-commit). If it does, hard-refresh and check that the workflow's "Stamp
  build version" step ran.
